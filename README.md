# tic-tac-toe

A simple tic-tac-toe game built using RxSwift. This project is using Swift 3 and requires XCode 8.2 or greater.

[http://reactivex.io/](http://reactivex.io/) is the place to go if I haven't explained the operators well enough.

### Dependencies:

RxSwift >= 3.x.x (see Cartfile)

The framework files are included, but not the carthage resolutions. If you want to upgrade you'll have to do that manually.

### App Icon:

Pretty obviously I made that myself.

### Credits:

The images for the board, cross and circle icons were taken from http://wp.me/p7UH2k-1i, via this video on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rD3uqeLdal8
